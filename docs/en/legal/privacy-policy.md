# Privacy Policy

**Last Update:** July 30, 2025

Welcome to AIVAX. This Privacy Policy describes how AIVAX collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects user information from our AI inference services. Our commitment is to transparency and the protection of your data, in full compliance with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) and the Brazilian Internet Civil Framework.

By using AIVAX services, the AIVAX account manager agrees to the practices described in this policy.

### 1. Definitions

- **AIVAX:** The company that provides AI inference services and is the author of this policy.
- **AIVAX Account Manager:** The physical or legal person who creates and administers an account on the AIVAX platform, being the primary target of this policy.
- **End User:** Individuals who interact with applications or services created by the AIVAX Account Manager that use the AIVAX API.
- **Inference Data:** The data (prompts, inputs, etc.) sent to AI models through the AIVAX API and the responses (inferences) generated by them.
- **Conversations:** The record of Inference Data interactions, including inputs and outputs.

---

### 2. Data Collection and Use

#### 2.1. Inference Data and Conversations

AIVAX processes the Inference Data that the AIVAX Account Manager sends through our API. This data is used exclusively to provide the requested inference service.

**Commitment to Non-Use for Training:**
AIVAX **never** uses Inference Data or Conversations from its customers to train its own AI models or for any purpose other than the strict provision of the contracted service. Your business data and end-user interactions remain yours.

#### 2.2. Conversation Storage

To ensure the reliability and quality of our services, AIVAX temporarily stores Conversations in its databases. This storage has the following purposes:

- **Monitoring and History:** Allow the AIVAX Account Manager to view usage history, monitor costs, and analyze application traffic.
- **Debugging:** In case of failures, errors, or unexpected behavior of the models, access to these records is essential for our technical team to diagnose and resolve problems efficiently.

Conversations are treated with maximum security and confidentiality. Access to this data is restricted to authorized personnel and limited to the mentioned purposes.

#### 2.3. Data Exclusion

The AIVAX Account Manager has total control over the stored data. Conversations are permanently removed from our production systems after a pre-established period, detailed in our technical documentation.

Additionally, the AIVAX Account Manager can, at any time, request the deletion of all stored conversations through the control panel of their AIVAX account. Once requested, the deletion is definitive and irreversible.

### 3. Third-Party Model Providers

AIVAX acts as an orchestrator, routing inference requests to various AI models provided by partner companies ("AI Providers"). It is crucial to understand that:

- **Third-Party Policies:** Each AI Provider has its own privacy policies and terms of use. By choosing to use a specific model through AIVAX, the AIVAX Account Manager is also subject to the terms of that provider.
- **Possible Use for Training by Third Parties:** Some of these AI Providers may use the inference data sent to their models for training and improvement of their own products and services.

AIVAX strives to clearly inform the origin of each model, but **strongly recommends** that the AIVAX Account Manager review the privacy policies of the AI Provider corresponding to the model they intend to use, especially if sensitive data is processed. AIVAX is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.

### 4. Responsibilities

#### 4.1. AIVAX Account Manager Responsibility

The **AIVAX Account Manager** is the controller of the data processed through their application and is integrally responsible for:

- **Model Use:** The choice of AI models and the suitability of their use for the intended purpose.
- **Conversation Content:** All content, including texts, images, or other data that transits through the AIVAX API, is the responsibility of the AIVAX Account Manager.
- **Personal Data:** The AIVAX Account Manager is responsible for ensuring that the collection and processing of end-users' personal data, carried out through the AIVAX API, comply with the LGPD and other applicable laws. This includes obtaining consent, when necessary, and managing the rights of the data subjects.

#### 4.2. AIVAX Disclaimer of Responsibility

AIVAX acts as an operator in the processing of data, following the instructions of the AIVAX Account Manager (materialized in API calls). Therefore, AIVAX **is not responsible** for the nature of the processed content or the purpose of the interaction between the end-user, the application, and the AI model. The relationship and legal obligations arising from the use of the final application are exclusively between the AIVAX Account Manager and their end-users.
