# Pricing

The AIVAX payment model is **pre-paid**, meaning you use our services with the balance you add to your account. We do not send invoices at the beginning of the month for your usage. This way, it is predictable to know how much you will spend using our inference and agent creation services.

AIVAX charges a small fee (variable by payment method) when adding credits to cover taxes, payment provider fees, and our service fee. The pricing of models and inference is provided directly by the inference providers and their models, such as Google and OpenAI. There are no fees or additions on top of these prices. You pay the same value you would pay to these providers directly.

We use different [services](/docs/en/builtin-tools) to help you create agentive assistants. Some tools and services have a cost, and these costs are passed on to your account without any additional fees.

Inference is charged in US dollars (USD), so there may be currency fluctuations when converting from your local currency to US dollars.

## Bring-your-own-key (BYOK)

You can bring your own OpenAI-compatible API key to use directly on AIVAX. Since we do not know which model you will be using, we do not charge anything on top of the inference you use on your models. Additionally, when using your own model with AIVAX, the rate limits are increased to **3,600 requests per minute**, which is equivalent to 60 requests per second.

Note that you are still charged for services you use with your own models, such as [RAG](/docs/en/entities/collections.md), internet search, image generation, etc. If your account has a negative balance, you will not be able to use any services, including inference for your own API keys, until you add balance again.
