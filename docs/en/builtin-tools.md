# Built-in Tools

AIVAX provides a list of built-in tools for you to enable in your model. These tools can be used together with the [server-side functions](/docs/en/protocol-functions).

Some functions have a cost. This cost is applied to models used by AIVAX and those you provide via BYOK (bring-your-own-key), so it’s important to add balance if you intend to use these tools.

Note that each model decides which function to call and its parameters. Not all models may obey the call rules.

## Internet Search

This function enables internet search in your model. With this, the model can query specific or real‑time information, such as weather data, news, game results, etc.

Internet search is performed by several providers, chosen based on network availability and latency. The current providers used by AIVAX are [linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) and [Exa](https://exa.ai/).

AIVAX provides two types of search configurable via your dashboard:

- **Full**: the search performed is complete, inserting the entire content of each result found into the conversation context.
- **Summarized**: the search performed is summarized, inserting a summary generated by AI from the provider into the conversation context.

The cost of both modes is **$5** per **1,000** searches performed. The `Full` mode may consume more input tokens of the conversation, but can provide more accurate results.

## Advanced Internet Search

This function allows the model to have an internet browser and perform automation, such as searches, navigating sites, filling forms and clicking buttons.

At the moment there is no parametrization of this function.

The cost of this function is **$2** per hour of automation, also a fixed amount of **$11.10** per **1,000** calls of this function.

## Code Execution

This function allows the model to execute JavaScript code and inspect the execution result. With this, the model can evaluate, through algorithms, results of mathematical expressions and other situations better represented through code.

The code is executed in a protected environment with very few functions available. The model will not be able to access I/O, internet access or import scripts via this tool.

This function has no cost.

## URL Context

This function allows the model to access external content at URLs and links provided by the user. With this function, the model can access links and evaluate their content.

Note that some destinations may identify the access as a bot and block it, as this function is not crawling but a simple GET to the destination.

The model can access up to 5 links at a time. Only the first 10 MB of the links are read. Upon obtaining the link content, the system checks the returned content and handles it according to each type:

- HTML contents are rendered: HTML tags, scripts, CSS and “noise” are removed from the access result, keeping only the plain text of the link.
- Other textual contents: the content is read directly and no transformation is performed.
- Non‑textual contents: when the link responds with non‑textual content and the response indicates a filename (either via the path or the `Content-Disposition` header), the system attempts to convert the downloaded file to a textual version.

This function has no cost.

## Memory

This function allows the model to store relevant content to be used across multiple conversations.

> At the moment, this function is only available when used in [chat clients](/docs/en/entities/chat-clients) and when the session is identified by a `tag`.

Through the session `tag`, the model stores a relevant piece of conversation data, such as name preferences, reminders or actions the assistant should perform.

The instruction of this memory tells the model not to save sensitive or personal data; however, it is not guaranteed that the model will always follow this rule.

The data is stored for one year in AIVAX’s databases and can be deleted at any time by the platform. For every conversation via a chat client, this data is retrieved and attached to the conversation.

This function has no cost.

## Image Generation

This function allows the model to create AI images.

The AI‑generated images are attached in the conversation context, but are not directly visible to the assistant.

Currently, there are four categories of generated images:

![Image quality](/assets/img/imgquality.png)

- **Low quality**: generates images quickly with low cost, however may produce many artifacts, such as extra fingers, distorted eyes, misplaced arms.
- **Medium quality**: balance between good quality and speed, but may still generate artifacts.
- **High quality**: higher quality images and lower chance of artifacts.
- **Ultra high quality**: the highest quality in image generation. After generation, an upscaling model adjusts the created image.

This function has a cost. The cost varies with the processing time of each image, which is affected by processing consumption, queue size, models used, etc. Image generation occurs on an external provider, so the cost can change based on various factors.

The example image above shows a price forecast for each image quality.

You can also enable explicit and adult image generation. When this feature is enabled, the model will be allowed to generate adult material. For this to happen, the model must also “agree” to generate this content. Certain models have a lower safety filter than others. For example, Gemini models have the lowest safety filter, being a viable option for role‑play and generation of this type of material.

You are always responsible for the [material you generate](/docs/en/legal/terms-of-service.md) and the generated material must be compatible with our terms of service.

Generated images are stored on AIVAX servers for a few months before being permanently removed.

## X Posts Search

This function allows the model to search for posts on X (formerly Twitter).

It is a direct alternative to `web_search`, as it can be used to look for up‑to‑date real‑time information, such as news, information, game results, etc. This tool brings much more recent results than conventional internet search.

It is not recommended to use both functions together as they have the same purpose.

Currently, the latest 20 posts on a given topic are inserted into the conversation context, containing link and author.

Currently, it is not possible to access posts from specific profiles.

The cost of this function is **$5** per **1,000** searches performed.

## Document Generation

This function allows the model to create PDFs from HTML text.

The created files are hosted on AIVAX servers and made available by the assistant.

The content is hosted for a few months before being permanently deleted.

This function has no cost.

## Web Page Generation

This function allows the model to host HTML pages on AIVAX servers.

This allows the model to host reports, landing pages and other HTML infographics.

The content is hosted for a few months before being permanently deleted.

This function has no cost.
