# Authentication

When you have your account in hand, use your unique authentication key to authenticate on our API through the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://inference.aivax.net/api/v1/information/models.txt \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer oky_gr5uepj...'
```

You can also send your authorization token through the query parameter `?api-key`, example:

```bash
curl https://inference.aivax.net/api/v1/information/models.txt?api-key=oky_gr5uepj...
```

There is no need to send the `Bearer` authentication scheme in both headers, but it is possible for compatibility reasons.

## Authenticating a nonce

Nonces are generated by webhooks and protocol functions to authenticate transactions made by AIVAX in external content. In requests that include the `X-Aivax-Nonce` header, validate this token by calling this endpoint:

<div class="request-item get">
    <span>POST</span>
    <span>
        /api/v1/auth/nonce
    </span>
</div>

```json
{
    "nonce": "kgnjcyjy7ksz5eeocc4iw14bre.7cahcn8phfmrdkidhqaecp4e4w"
}
```

> Note: this route requires authentication to work.

A response for a validated nonce is returned in this format:

```json
{
    "message": null,
    "data": {
        "validated": true,
        "reason": "The nonce informed is valid and has been consumed."
    }
}
```

When validating a nonce, it is consumed, and it is not possible to validate the same nonce again. Nonces must be validated within 10 minutes of their issuance.
