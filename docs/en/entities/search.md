# Search

The search API, through the query key obtained from the collections, performs a semantic search on it, performing an intelligent comparison for each indexed document in a collection.

After creating a collection, you will get its ID. Use the ID of your collection to perform the search on the indexed documents of the same.

Use the endpoints of this API to embed the semantic search of documents in your AI model or chatbot.

## Searching documents

This endpoint expects a GET request with the following parameters:

- `term`: **required.** Specifies the search term that will be searched in the documents.
- `top`: Specifies the maximum number of documents that should be returned in the search.
- `min`: Specifies the minimum score for obtaining the documents.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Warning: this endpoint generates cost. The cost is calculated based on the tokens of the search term. The search term is tokenized according to the model used in the indexing of the documents.

For the search result, the higher the score, the more similar the document is to the search term. AIVAX uses embedding models that allow task orientation. For the search, the term is vectorized with a `DOCUMENT_QUERY` orientation. For document indexing, the orientation is `DOCUMENT_RETRIEVAL`, which provides a more optimized search and not to verify the similarity between documents.
