# Chat Clients

A chat client provides a user interface through an [AI Gateway](/docs/en/entities/ai-gateway) that allows the user to converse with their assistant. A chat client is integrated with the AI gateway's inference and supports deep thinking, research, and text conversation. Multi-modal features, such as sending images and audio, are under development.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Open Indexer never stores the content of a chat between a client and the user. You can use JavaScript for this task, but it is your responsibility to use and store it.

You can customize the interface of your chat client with custom CSS and JavaScript, as well as choose the language of the chat features.

## Creating a Chat Session

A chat session is where you create a conversation between your chat client and the user. You can call this endpoint providing additional context for the conversation, such as the user's name, location, etc.

A chat session expires after a certain time for security reasons of the generated access token. When you call this endpoint providing a `tag`, you can call the same endpoint multiple times and get the active chat session for the informed tag, or create a new chat if there is no ongoing session.

A chat session also restores all conversation messages from the same session after disconnection. The user can clear the conversation by clicking the clear conversation button in the top right corner of the chat client. This session uses the limits defined by the chat client, such as the maximum number of messages and tokens in the conversation.

A session is automatically renewed for another 3 days when receiving a message from the user.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> It is only possible to determine the number of tokens used in a message when using a [model provided by the Open Indexer](/docs/en/models). If you use an external model, the `limitingParameters.userInputMaxTokens` property will be ignored.

<div class="request-item post">

    "expires": 3600,

    // Optional (recommended). An external ID to identify the session later and reuse it whenever you call the same endpoint. It can be the ID of the user in your database or a string that facilitates the identification of this chat later.
